# CricketScore: First Innings Score Prediction
Introduction:


CricketScore First Innings Score Prediction is a machine learning project that focuses on predicting the first innings scores in cricket matches for various formats, including IPL (Indian Premier League), ODI (One Day International), and T20 (Twenty20) matches. By leveraging historical match data from these formats, the project aims to provide accurate predictions of the scores, enabling cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and sports professionals to gain valuable insights into team performances.

Dataset:


The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset that includes Ball-By-Ball Data from a wide range of cricket matches across IPL, ODI, and T20 formats. This dataset provides detailed information about each ball bowled, including batting team, bowling team, runs scored, wickets taken, and other relevant match parameters. This data serves as the foundation for training and testing the prediction models.

Algorithms Used:


The project employs two regression algorithms, namely Linear Regression and Random Forest, to predict the first innings scores. These algorithms have been chosen for their ability to handle numerical data and capture complex relationships between input features and the target variable. By training these models on the historical match data, the project aims to generate accurate predictions for first innings scores.

Converting Ball-By-Ball Data to Over-By-Over Data:


To further enhance the accuracy of the predictions, the project aims to convert the Ball-By-Ball Data into Over-By-Over Data. By aggregating the ball-level information into overs, the dataset will provide a more structured and informative representation of the match progression. This conversion process will help capture important trends, scoring patterns, and momentum shifts that occur within overs and improve the predictive capabilities of the models.

Usage and Contributions:


The GitHub repository provides the necessary code, documentation, and datasets required to run the prediction models and explore the project further. Users can follow the instructions provided to preprocess the data, train the models, and make predictions. Contributions to the project are welcome, including improvements to the prediction algorithms, feature engineering techniques, and enhancements to the dataset.

Happy predicting first innings scores in cricket matches!
